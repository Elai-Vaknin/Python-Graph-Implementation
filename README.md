Project by Elai Vaknin & Daniel Tzafrir

# Data Structures:
## NodeData:
The class that represent a node in the graph.</br>
id = each node has a key.</br>
tag = a float type attribute to help with algorithms.</br>
info = a string type attribute to help with algorithms.</br>
pos = 3d tuple to store position.</br>
